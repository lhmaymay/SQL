Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (SELECT num, LEAD(num,1) OVER () AS num1, LEAD(num,2) OVER() AS num2
FROM logs) AS a
WHERE num=num1 and num=num2;
