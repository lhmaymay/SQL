table employee has columns id, salary
find the salary value that is the n-th highest
return null when no nth highest salary, name it as getNthHighestSalary


# Solution 
WITH cte AS 
(SELECT a.*, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rk
FROM employee a) 

SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT salary)<N THEN NULL
ELSE (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM cte WHERE rk=N) END AS getNthHighestSalary
FROM employee;
